    <p>These coconut shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying. Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce â€” I use orange marmalade, mustard, and horseradish mixed to taste for a dipping sauce.</p>

    <p>This coconut shrimp is perfectly crispy and beautifully golden brown. Plus, it's incredibly easy to make!</p>

    <ul>
    <b> <li>Ingredients</li></b> 
      <ul>
        <li>You'll need all-purpose flour, an egg, beer, and baking powder for the beer batter.</li>

        <li>Make sure to use unsweetened coconut flakes.</li>
        <li>Use a cooking oil with a high smoke point, such as peanut oil or vegetable oil.</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>

      <ul>
    <b>  <li>Directions</li></b>
