    <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>These coconut shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying. Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce â€” I use orange marmalade, mustard, and horseradish mixed to taste for a dipping sauce.</p>
      <p>This coconut shrimp is perfectly crispy and beautifully golden brown. Plus, it's incredibly easy to make!</p>
